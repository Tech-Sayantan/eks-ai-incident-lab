# EKS AI Incident Lab — Study Notes

These notes grow after each hands-on checkpoint. They distinguish verified lab results from the production practices discussed for interviews.

| Note | Topics |
|---|---|
| [01 — Terraform bootstrap and GitHub OIDC](01-terraform-bootstrap-and-oidc.md) | State, backend, provider, locking, IAM roles, trust, temporary credentials |
| [02 — Terraform CI and Trivy](02-terraform-ci-and-trivy.md) | GitHub Actions checks, static validation, IaC scanning, finding triage |
| [03 — VPC networking foundations](03-vpc-networking-foundations.md) | Region/AZ scope, routes, security groups versus NACLs, network plan, delivery path |
| [04 — PR, CI, CD and approvals](04-pr-ci-cd-and-approvals.md) | Git commands, checks versus reviews, merge versus deployment, lab and application flows |
| [05 — GitHub OIDC plan role](05-oidc-plan-role.md) | Trust versus permissions, state access, PR-to-apply order, failure diagnosis |
| [06 — First AWS network plan and Git](06-network-cloud-plan-and-git.md) | Verified cloud plan, staging, conflicts, cherry-pick, next apply checkpoint |
| [07 — Protected PR gate and network apply role](07-apply-role-and-merge-gates.md) | PR checks, reviews, merge, deployment gate, applied IAM role |

The lab code is typed and run by Tan. Notes are maintained by Trunks from observed output. No Terraform state, variable values, access keys, or saved plans belong in Git.

Current status: S3 bootstrap, GitHub OIDC, and Terraform format/validate/Trivy CI are verified. The manual cloud-plan run from `main` proposed eight network additions. `main` now requires a PR and the `check` job. PR #5 passed and merged; Tan applied the network apply IAM role, verified in AWS. The lab VPC and lab state object were absent at the latest check. Network apply is next; no EKS cluster is running.
